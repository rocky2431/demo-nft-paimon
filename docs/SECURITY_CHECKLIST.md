# Launchpad Security Checklist

> **Task**: RWA-006 (Launchpad Testing & Integration)
> **Generated**: 2025-10-27
> **Status**: Pre-Audit Review
> **Contracts**: ProjectRegistry, IssuanceController
> **Priority**: P0 (Critical - Handles User Funds)

## ✅ Completed Security Measures

### Access Control
- [x] **Owner-only functions** properly protected with `Ownable`
  - `approveIssuer()` - Only owner can approve issuers
  - `revokeIssuer()` - Only owner can revoke issuers
- [x] **Issuer permissions** checked before project submission
  - `submitProject()` requires `approvedIssuers[msg.sender]`
- [x] **VeNFT ownership** validated before voting
  - `vote()` checks `votingEscrow.ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender`

### Reentrancy Protection
- [x] **ReentrancyGuard** applied to all state-changing functions
  - `submitProject()` - `nonReentrant` modifier
  - `vote()` - `nonReentrant` modifier
  - `executeVote()` - `nonReentrant` modifier
  - `participate()` - `nonReentrant` modifier (IssuanceController)
  - `claim()` - `nonReentrant` modifier (IssuanceController)

### Input Validation
- [x] **Project submission** validations:
  - `_rwaToken != address(0)` - No zero address
  - `_targetRaise > 0` - Positive target raise
  - `_saleDuration > 0` - Positive duration
  - `_complianceDocURI` not empty - Required compliance docs
- [x] **Vote** validations:
  - Project exists check
  - Voting period not ended
  - No duplicate voting per veNFT
  - VeNFT ownership verification

### SafeERC20 Usage
- [x] **IssuanceController** uses `SafeERC20` for all token transfers
  - `participate()` - Safe USDC transfer from user
  - `claim()` - Safe RWA token transfer to user
  - `finalizeSale()` - Safe fee distribution

### Integer Overflow Protection
- [x] Solidity **0.8.20** with built-in overflow protection
- [x] No `unchecked` blocks in critical financial logic
- [x] BigInt arithmetic properly handled in frontend (TypeScript)

## ⚠️ Identified Risks & Mitigations

### HIGH RISK

#### 1. Vote Execution Timing Attack
**Risk**: Vote can be executed immediately after voting period ends, potentially frontrunning late voters
**Severity**: HIGH
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ **Implemented**: 7-day voting period provides sufficient time
- ✅ **Implemented**: Anyone can execute (no centralization risk)
- 🔄 **Recommended**: Add small buffer (e.g., 1 hour) between voting end and execution eligibility

#### 2. Fee Distribution Logic
**Risk**: Fee splitting between Treasury (70%) and vePool (30%) could have rounding errors
**Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH
**Current Implementation**:
```solidity
uint256 treasuryFee = totalFees * 70 / 100;
uint256 vePoolFee = totalFees * 30 / 100;
```
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ **Implemented**: Simple percentage split (no complex math)
- 🔄 **Recommended**: Add dust handling (remainder goes to Treasury)
- 🔄 **Recommended**: Emit events for fee distribution amounts

#### 3. IPFS URI Storage Gas Costs
**Risk**: Storing 3 IPFS URIs per project costs ~200K gas
**Severity**: LOW (UX issue, not security)
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ **Acceptable**: URIs needed for compliance verification on-chain
- 🔄 **Future**: Consider event-based storage for gas savings

### MEDIUM RISK

#### 4. veNFT Transfer During Voting
**Risk**: veNFT holder could transfer NFT after voting, affecting vote weight
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Current Protection**:
- ✅ `voteNFTOwner` mapping stores original voter
- ✅ Voting power captured at vote time
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ **Sufficient**: Voting power snapshot prevents gaming
- 📝 **Note**: ve-style locking discourages frivolous transfers

#### 5. Project Submission Spam
**Risk**: Approved issuers could spam project submissions
**Severity**: LOW-MEDIUM
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ **Implemented**: Only approved issuers can submit
- ✅ **Implemented**: Owner can revoke issuer approval
- 🔄 **Recommended**: Add submission cooldown period (e.g., 1 project per 24 hours)

### LOW RISK

#### 6. Gas Limit on Vote Counting
**Risk**: Very large numbers of votes could cause `executeVote()` to run out of gas
**Severity**: LOW (unlikely with realistic veNFT holder counts)
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ **Efficient**: Simple arithmetic operations only
- ✅ **Tested**: Gas benchmarked at 48K avg (well within block limit)

#### 7. Compliance Document Immutability
**Risk**: IPFS URIs cannot be updated after project submission
**Severity**: LOW (feature, not bug)
**Mitigation**:
- ✅ **Intentional**: Prevents issuer manipulation post-approval
- 📝 **Note**: New version requires new project submission

## 🔒 Smart Contract Security Best Practices

### Code Quality
- [x] **No inline assembly** - All code in high-level Solidity
- [x] **No delegatecall** - No proxy pattern risks
- [x] **No selfdestruct** - Contracts cannot be destroyed
- [x] **Explicit visibility** - All functions have visibility modifiers
- [x] **NatSpec comments** - Comprehensive documentation

### External Dependencies
- [x] **OpenZeppelin contracts** - Battle-tested libraries
  - `Ownable` v5.0.0
  - `ReentrancyGuard` v5.0.0
  - `SafeERC20` v5.0.0
- [x] **Minimal external calls** - Only to VotingEscrow and ERC20 tokens

### Testing Coverage
- [x] **Unit tests**: 26/26 ProjectRegistry tests passing
- [x] **Edge cases**: Duplicate votes, zero values, unauthorized access
- [x] **Gas benchmarks**: All functions measured
- [⏳] **Integration tests**: Work-in-progress (compilation issues)
- [⏳] **Invariant tests**: Needed for IssuanceController

- [x] Security considerations documented

### External Review
- [ ] Internal code review by team
- [ ] External security audit (recommended before mainnet)
- [ ] Testnet deployment and testing

## 📋 Audit Preparation

### Scope
**Contracts to Audit**:
1. `ProjectRegistry.sol` (~300 lines)
2. `IssuanceController.sol` (~400 lines)

**Out of Scope** (already audited or separate):
- VotingEscrow.sol (core contract, separate audit)
- Treasury.sol (core contract, separate audit)

### Known Issues
1. Integration test compilation errors (non-security issue)
2. IssuanceController has 11 failing unit tests (requires investigation)

### Timeline Recommendation
- **Week 1-2**: Fix failing tests and integration test compilation
- **Week 3**: Internal security review
- **Week 4**: Submit to external auditor
- **Week 5-6**: Audit and remediation
- **Week 7**: Testnet deployment
- **Week 8+**: Mainnet deployment after successful testnet period

## 🚨 Critical Pre-Launch Actions
